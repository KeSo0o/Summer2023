 <!-- Note:

     Såg först när jag hade gjort klart detta projekt att man
     skulle använda tailwind och jag har inte tid att just nu
     börja göra om allt och börja lära mig hur tailwind fungerar
     så det får vara såhär nu.


      Navbarens knappar funkar inte och vet inte varför.
      Texten på första sidan fick jag inte några hover effekter på.
      "Tell me a joke" funktionen fungerar inte.
